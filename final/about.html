					<h1>Menchie's world</h1>
					<p>Menchie started mixing when he was only a baby. It quickly became his passion and led him to do what he loves and love what he does: making mixes of yogurt and toppings with his sweet friends.

                    <p>Together, the MENCHIE represent the United Flavors of Yumm (UFY) and travel the world in the pursuit of yumminess with one mission in mind: to spread the yumm with smiles. In the UFY, any mix possible and all mixes are created equal.</p>

                    <p> Now, be a Menchie Friend and carpe yumm! Grab a cup, enjoy the sweet ride!</p>
                    <br>
					<h1>Our Products</h1>
					<p>The Menchie's Private Label Collection is made exclusively with our own custom blend of flavors that you won't find anywhere else. We strive to offer something for every guest and pride ourselves on using only the highest quality ingredients.</p>
                        
                    <p> Our frozen yogurt is a good source of calcium as it is made with fresh milk from our California dairy, and our "smiley" California cows have not been treated with artificial growth hormones (rBST). Our product line boasts gluten-free, vegan, and no high fructose corn syrup options and we strive to use natural flavors including real cake, cookies, spices, fruits and nuts.</p>
                        
                    <p>Our entire line of frozen yogurt is certified Kosher and is awarded the live and active culture seal by the National Yogurt Association. Menchie's focuses on quality, variety and innovation in order to produce our best-in-class frozen yogurt. Our innovative research and development team works diligently to come up with fun and exciting flavors so there is always something new to try at a store near you. </p>
