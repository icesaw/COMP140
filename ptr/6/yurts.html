      and a roof dome that can be opened.</p>
      <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
      <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also
        includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the
        lodge.</p>
        <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
        <p>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress
          for changing weather with layers of clothing.</p> <br>
